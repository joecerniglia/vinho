# Wines of the vinho verde region of Portugal are especially prized for their freshness and quality.
# The code in this project runs a scatter graph that displays ratings of professional wine tasters. Each rating is represented by a colored dot on the graph.
# The dots are arranged on an xy plot, with the x-axis representing pH (lower values are more acidic; higher values are more basic) and with the y-axis representing percentage of alcohol content.

# What the scatter plot appears to show is that vinho verde wines with a higher percentage of acohol content are generally given higher taster ratings than those with a lower percentage of alcohol content.
